Single-shot high-performance quantitative phase imaging with a Physics-inspired plug-and-play denoiser for polarization differential interference contrast (PDIC) microscopy. The quantitative phase is recovered by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), balancing total variance regularization and a pre-trained Dense Residual U-net (DRUNet) denoiser. The custom DRUNet uses the Tanh activation function to guarantee the symmetry requirement for phase retrieval.
